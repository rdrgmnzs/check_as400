AS400 Nagios/Icinga Plugin - Installation instructions
----------------------------------------------------

Preinstall notes
-------------------
* Make sure you modify the JAVA_START path in the check_as400 script.

* Security Note: Realize that this plugin communicates to the AS400 via telnet, which is easy to sniff and capture user names and passwords.  Use a generic user with restrictive rights for the plugin. The user needs access to wrksyssts, wrkoutq, wrkactjob, dspjob, dspsbsd and dspmsg.


Quick And Easy
-----------------
* For languages other than English you will need to recompile the plugin before continuing.  Refer to steps 1 and 2 of the Manual installation section below.

* Type 

   ./install

* Modify your $NAGIOS_PATH/libexec/.as400 with the correct user and password

* Add the contents of the checkcommands.example file into your $NAGIOS/etc/checkcommands.cfg 

* Add services to your nagios configuration.  There are examples in the services.example file.

* Add dependencies to your nagios configuration.  There are examples in the dependency.example file.

* DONE!


Manual Installation 
-------------------
1) If you use a language other than English, re-link the proper language source class from the ./langs directory by typing

	rm check_as400_lang.java
	ln -s langs/check_as400_lang_(your language).java .

2) Compile the plugin:

	javac check_as400.java

3) Copy all .class files to nagios/libexec if you are using nagios or icinga/libexec if you are using icinga.

	cp *.class /usr/nagios/libexec
	or
	cp *.class /usr/local/icinga/libexec

4) Copy the check_as400 script to nagios/libexec if you are using nagios or icinga/libexec if you are using icinga.
	
	cp check_as400 /usr/nagios/libexec
	or
	cp check_as400 /usr/local/icinga/libexec

5) Add the contents of checkcommands.example to your checkcommands.cfg

6) Create a file in nagios/libexec if you are using nagios or icinga/libexec if you are using icinga,
   called .as400, with contents matching that of the file example.as400.  This file contains the user
   name and password used to login to the as400.

7) Change the user and group of these files to your nagios user. 

Security Note! Set the permissions of the nagios/libexec/.as400 file you created in step 5 to 700.
This way only the nagios user can read the contents of this file.

	cd /usr/nagios/libexec

	chown nagios:nagios *.class check_as400 .as400 
	chmod 700 .as400 

8) Add services to your nagios configuration.  There are examples in the services.example file.

Enjoy!
